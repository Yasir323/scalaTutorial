Definition:
A class is defined with the class keyword while an object is defined
using the object keyword. Also, whereas a class can take parameters,
an object can’t take any parameter.

Instantiation:
To instantiate a regular class, we use the new keyword. For an object,
we don’t need the new keyword.

Singleton vs Multi-instance:
While a class can have an unlimited number of instances, an object has
just one instance created lazily when we first reference it.

Inheritance:
Since an object is a singleton, it cannot be inherited/extended; doing
so will result in creating more than an instance of the object – a
class, on the other hand, can be extended.
